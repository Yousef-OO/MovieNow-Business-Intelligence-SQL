# MovieNow-Business-Intelligence-SQL

Used SQL to support decision making. It is based on a case study about an online movie rental company with a database about customer information, movie ratings, background information on actors and more. I applied my SQL knowledge to write queries to extract insights into customer preferences, customer engagement, and sales development. I've also utilized SQL extensions for online analytical processing (OLAP), which made it easier to obtain key insights from multidimensional aggregated data.

**Where to go from here?**
1. MovieNow_Analysis.sql: Contains the complete SQL queries used in the whole project.

2. Project_Overview.pdf: Detailed scenario description, database schema (ERD), and metadata.

3. /dataset: CSV files containing the raw data for customers, movies, rentals, and actors.


**Key Business Questions Answered**:
1. Content Performance: Which genres and actors drive the highest rental volume vs. average ratings?

2. Customer Behavior: How do demographics (age, gender, location) correlate with streaming frequency?

3. Regional Growth: Which countries/regions are the primary drivers of revenue?
